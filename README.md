This project includes a simple Flutter authentication flow with four main pages. The login page lets users enter their email and password with features like a password toggle and a link for forgotten passwords. The signup page allows new users to create an account with email, password, and confirm-password fields. The reset password page provides a quick way for users to request a password reset by entering their email. After successful authentication, the home page displays a welcome message and a logout button. Together, these pages form a clean, basic structure that can be connected to Firebase or any backend for full authentication functionality.
